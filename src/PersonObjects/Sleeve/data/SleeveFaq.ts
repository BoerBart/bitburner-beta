"<strong><u>What is Synchronization (Sync)?</strong></u><br>",
"Synchronization is a measure of how aligned your consciousness is with",

"it affects how much experience is earned when the sleeve is performing a task.<br><br>",
"Let N be the sleeve's synchronization. When the sleeve earns experience by performing a",
"task, both the sleeve and the player's original host consciousness earn N%",
"of the amount of experience normally earned by the task. All of the player's",
"other sleeves earn ((N/100)^2 * 100)% of the experience.<br><br>",
