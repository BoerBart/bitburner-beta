Sleeves
=======
When VitaLife unveiled their Persona Core technology that allowed people to digitize
and transfer their consciousness into other vessels, human bodies became nothing more
than 'sleeves' for the human consciousness. This technology thus became known as
"Sleeve technology".

Sleeve technology unlocks two different gameplay features:

* Duplicate Sleeves
* Re-sleeving

Sleeve technology is unlocked in :ref:`BitNode-10 <gameplay_bitnodes>`.

Duplicate Sleeves
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Duplicate Sleeves are MK-V Synthoids (synthetic androids) into which your consciuosness
has been copied. In other words, these Synthoids contain a perfect duplicate of your mind.

Duplicate Sleeves are essentially clones which you can use to perform work-type actions,
such as working for a company/faction or committing a crime. When sleeves perform these tasks,
they will earn money, experience, and reputation.

Sleeves are their own individuals, which means they each have their own experience and stats.

When a sleeve earns experience, it earns experience for itself, the player's
original consciousness, as well as all of the player's other sleeves.

Synchronization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Synchronization is a measure of how aligned your consciousness is with that of your
Duplicate Sleeves. It is a numeral value between 1 and 100, and it affects how much experience
is earned when the sleeve is performing a task.

Let N be the sleeve's synchronization. When the sleeve earns experience by performing
a task, both the sleeve and the player's original host consciousness of N% of the
amount of experience normally earned by the task. All of the player's other sleeves
earn ((N/100)^2 * 100)% of the experience.

Synchronization can be increased by assigning sleeves to the 'Synchronize' task.

Sleeve Shock
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Sleeve shock is a measure of how much trauma the sleeve has due to being placed in a new
body. It is a numeral value between 0 and 99, where 99 indicates full shock and 0 indicates
no shock. Shock affects the amount of experience earned by the sleeve.

Sleeve shock slowly decreases over time. You can further increase the rate at which
it decreases by assigning sleeves to the 'Shock Recovery' task.

Re-sleeving
^^^^^^^^^^^
